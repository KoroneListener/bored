# bored
test is a small program that gives the sequences of S's and X's of length n, in which the number of X's never exceeds the number of S's, and in which there are m more S's then X's in all.
$G(x,z) = \sum_{n,m}g_{n,m}x^mz^n$

# stack
A permutation can be obtained using a stack if and only if there are no indices i < j < k such that $p_j$ < $p_k$ < $p_i$.

# seq
compute the sequence bn, which represents the number of admissible sequences of length 2n where the number of 'X's never exceeds the number of 'S's, and there are m more 'S's than 'X's in the entire sequence, ref test.c
